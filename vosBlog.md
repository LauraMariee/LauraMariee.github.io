Week 1:
Environment:
A basic environment for VR was created along with teleportation, lighting, and Steam VR. There is also UI which changes the model from male to female. 

Models:
Got 2 models â€“ male and female off the internet but it had the correct licensing. I put basic clothes on them and then made them into prefabs within Unity. The model prefabs have the appropriate components, so they spin on the spot. They are also rigged to make posing them easier.
