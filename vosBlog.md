## Week 1:
Environment:
A basic environment for VR was created along with teleportation, lighting, and Steam VR. There is also UI which changes the model from male to female. 

Models:
Got 2 models â€“ male and female off the internet but it had the correct licensing. I put basic clothes on them and then made them into prefabs within Unity. The model prefabs have the appropriate components, so they spin on the spot. They are also rigged to make posing them easier. 


## Week 2
Environment:
Started a few scripts to set up dynamic lever system. Still to be tested and only 
works with values - not models. 
Also added spin debug panel - basic prototype. 
Moved change model buttons to the platform. 

Models:
Created a platform and levers to control the model dimensions. 

Research:
Did research regarding body sizes and decided on using common sizes for presets.
Asos website size guide for reference. 
 
Decided on changing the traits:
- Neck
- Shoulder
- Leg Length
- Arm Length
- Waist 
- Hip

## Week 3
Environment:
Created an upated lever podium with UI and working levers. Levers link with the model and should change the scale depending on the position.   

Models:
Re-rigged the female model to support posing and bone transformations. It needs polishing with certain areas but a prototype has been shown.
The male model needs to be rigged.  

Research:
Figured out appropriate scaling on the 3D model and examined measurement tables. 

Bugs:
Generated steam VR input, fixed usability issues and detected scaling issues.

Usability issues include:
- Teleporting
- Extra momentum on handles
- Scene scaling
