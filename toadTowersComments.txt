A nice relaxing/puzzle game. A bit laggy upon card selection on my side. There is a lot of levels and a nice variety of card, quite impressive for a jam ! I just wish i could see my frogs populating the city :D I felt it was a bit off the theme though, as the event to check my tower stability werenâ€™t occuring very often.

GG and thanks for the game!

This is a cool idea! The UI is a little awkward to use, but the concept is strong, and the frogs are super cute. This is an impressive amount of work for a jam!
