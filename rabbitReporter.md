## Introduction
They said it could not be done! A Visual Novel game with branching dialogue timelines and hand painted assets, all in one jam game?
Follow Ricky Reporter Rabbit on his journalistic adventures to find out the local scoop!

Although the in-game hint tells you otherwise, unfortunately we ran out of time to add more stories, so every rabbit only has one story to tell in the jam version. Because of this, there also is no win or lose state in the jam version.
