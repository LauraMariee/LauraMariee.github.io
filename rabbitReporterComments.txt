this is very charming and cute!!!

I love the artstyle choice. when I saw it I instantly wanted to check the game! It’s very well done and it really helps it stand out!

I like the use of the theme, it’s pretty creative! there’s a good variety in what you can put in the news paper as far as subjects and I like that The writing is really good, it got a few chuckles out of me, I enjoyed going around interviewing all characters and everything they had to say!

I would love to see this expanded with more stories to report on and and different plotlines and such

I see a lot of potential here!

Good game with a strange concept, but a clever use of the theme. I really liked the mechanic where you assembled your newspaper. Unusual aesthetic for a solid entry. Well done. Thank you. I wish you the best ++
