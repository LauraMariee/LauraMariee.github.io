You wake up, in a place that you’ve never seen before. What is going on? Who summoned you to this place?

But first, you need to find your friends, they somehow got spread through space and time.

	<p><strong>"</strong>This is a game with chill vibes, and extra kudos for including red pandas (because they’re awesome). Voxel art was beautiful and clean, the audio was chill but slightly repetative. It’s a great puzzle and deciphering game to work out the fruits to the symbols, and tickled my code cracker fancies. Great work, well done!

	<p><strong>"</strong>Well done! I loved the vibes! The puzzle was fun to solve. You had some clever and funny dialogue when chatting with the red pandas and balanced having to discover things and not crossing into frustration. I loved seeing the new islands come in, made me happy every time!<strong>"</strong></p>
