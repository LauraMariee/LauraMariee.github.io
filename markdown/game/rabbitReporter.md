# Rabbit Reporter!

![banner](/images/rabbbitReporter/newspaper.png)

## Introduction
They said it could not be done! A Visual Novel game with branching dialogue timelines and hand painted assets, all in one jam game?
Follow Ricky Reporter Rabbit on his journalistic adventures to find out the local scoop!

Although the in-game hint tells you otherwise, unfortunately we ran out of time to add more stories, so every rabbit only has one story to tell in the jam version. Because of this, there also is no win or lose state in the jam version.

	<p><strong>"</strong>this is very charming and cute!!! I love the artstyle choice. when I saw it I instantly wanted to check the game! It’s very well done and it really helps it stand out!
I like the use of the theme, it’s pretty creative! there’s a good variety in what you can put in the news paper as far as subjects and I like that The writing is really good, it got a few chuckles out of me, I enjoyed going around interviewing all characters and everything they had to say! I would love to see this expanded with more stories to report on and and different plotlines and such

I see a lot of potential here!

	<p><strong>"</strong>Good game with a strange concept, but a clever use of the theme. I really liked the mechanic where you assembled your newspaper. Unusual aesthetic for a solid entry. Well done. Thank you. I wish you the best ++<strong>"</strong></p>
