# Catch A Cat BTS

## Overview

This project is to showcase my integration skills between Unity, Unreal Engine and a backend server via ASP.net.
The main premise is to:
- Create a game in Unreal.
- Create a companion app to display data regarding the game.
- Create a backend to store and query that data.

There is a project board [linked here](https://github.com/users/LauraMariee/projects/2.html).
