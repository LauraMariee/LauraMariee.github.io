# Penguin Paradise - Behind the scenes

## Game Design

### Characters:
- Penguins because there is a range of different specis with different characteristics and colours. 
- Plus, they are cute and known to be in more than Ice areas.

### Art Style:
- Voxel because it was new to the team and I and more poular games such as minecraft were using similar art style.
- General USP for the game jam community. 
- Also quick and better suited to prototyping. Software is also open source.

### Mechanics:
- Town builder/Idle Game because as a team we enjoy strategy games and I wanted to put a cute spin on it. 
- Click and place buildings and manage penguin economy to build final building. 
- Theme was "Deeper and Deeper" so the late game spin of extra resource collection using the well fit it with the theme. 

### Economy:
- Penguin workers have certain roles so you need to manage reources to complete each of the quests. 
- Some Penguins take more Resources so the player has to take that into account plus added more challenge.
