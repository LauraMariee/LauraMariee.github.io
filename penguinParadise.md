## Introduction
“Well Well Well, if it isn’t the consequences of trying to go deeper and deeper into reality….”

Stranded after an experiment, you and your penguin friends need to gather resources to recover.

First on the surface of the planet, but sooner or later digging into the well seems very tempting.
