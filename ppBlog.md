# Penguin Paradise - Behind the scenes

<p> - Characters:
	Penguins because there was a range of different specis, they are cute and known to be in more than Ice areas.
</p>
<p> - Art Style:
	- Voxel because it was new to me and more poular games such as minecraft were using similar art style.
		General USP for the game jam community. 
	- Also quick and better suited to prototyping. Software is also open source.
	- Link to Magica Voxel.
</p> 	
<p> - Mechanics:
	- Town builder/Idle Game because as a team we enjoy strategy games and I wanted to put a cute spin on it. 
	- Click and place buildings and manage penguin economy to build final building. 
	- Theme was "Deeper and Deeper" so the late game spin of extra resource collection using the well fit it with the theme. 
	- Also added more content.
</p>
<p> - Economy:
	- Penguin workers have certain roles so you need to manage reources to complete each of the quests. 
	- Some Penguins take more fish so have to take that into account plus added more challenge.
