Holy Macaroni Penguins, what is this game!? There’s an incredible amount of content here for a jam game, congratulations! You start out with a couple of tents, then half an hour later you’re managing 100+ penguins and 13 different resources to build an ice-monument with robot penguins, crazy stuff…

I can’t add much to what was already said above: QOL updates would be great, but ultimately I too just gave up at the monument after I couldn’t make it complete a single percent, even though it was consuming resources… The game has turned into a bit too much of an idle/clicker game by that point, but the progression and awe I felt until that point was outstanding. Hats off!

What HUUUGE work ! I’m so impressed by the result, it’s so difficult to make this kind of game during a jam muscle

I think, there is all required features to make the game interesting. Voxel design is cute (specialy peeguins). With more animations and Fx the game could be very juicy and become a commercial game.

There is an issue, sometimes, I can’t drop the building and it stuck on the mouse cursor.

Great game !
