Love the game so far, really makes me hungry for some sushi. Although a complaint I have is that I have to blindly make a bunch of sushi and hope a catstomer takes it. I feel that hints should show up a bit more often. Maybe even consider speeding up the pace of the game a little bit? It does feel a bit slow for the food to get to catstomers.

Very nice job though! I was getting into the game after a while, and the tune is pretty catchy.

Very much like overcooked, but fun and well executed still. The tutorial mode worked really nicely for explaining how to go about things too.
